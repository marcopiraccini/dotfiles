# Collection of zsh / vim configurations.

Partially inspired by: https://github.com/lucasfcosta/dotfiles

**This is configured for Linux** (so no fancy OSx stuff :) but the goal is to have a common configuration that I can use in both Ubuntu and OSx.
It's also pretty basic since it assumes that everything (oh_my_zsh, nvim, etc), is already installed since will be installed in different way depending on the OS 

# Manual steps:
in VIM: 
- :CocInstall coc-rust-analyzer
