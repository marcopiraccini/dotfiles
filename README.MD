# Collection of zsh / vim / tmux configurations.

Partially inspired by: https://github.com/lucasfcosta/dotfiles

**This is configured for Linux** (so no fancy OSx stuff :) but the goal is to have a common configuration that I can use in both Ubuntu and OSx.
It's also pretty basic since it assumes that everything (oh_my_zsh, nvim, etc), is lready installed 

TODO: complete and add a install script / instructions.
