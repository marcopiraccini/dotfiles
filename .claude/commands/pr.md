# PR Command

Clean up code, stage changes, and prepare a pull request.

Steps:
1. Run the linter/formatter to clean up code (e.g., `npx standard --fix` for Standard JS projects)
2. Show the user what files were modified
3. Stage all changes with `git add .`
4. Ask the user if they want to proceed with creating a pull request
5. If yes, follow the standard PR creation process
